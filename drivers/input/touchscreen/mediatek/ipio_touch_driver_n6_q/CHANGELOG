	1.	進入ICEM mode 增加讀取chip id判斷
		讀取成功=> 取代目前chip id (為避免開機第一次讀取chip id 失敗)

	2.	加入DDI Reg 寫入/讀取的節點
	3.	讀取chip id時stop MCU
	4.	修正sort test 讀取ini TDF參數錯誤=>改為讀進來的參數統一乘以100，ini  tdf最多到小數點後第二位
	5.	Show mp 各測試項driver 下給FW cmd於測試報告csv上
	6.	MP新增open test_c 測試項
	7.	修正NoFlash load code retry如果失敗，沒有讀取結果
	8.	修改fw 更新retry機制，如果retry失敗則清除flash/IRAM(HW reset)
